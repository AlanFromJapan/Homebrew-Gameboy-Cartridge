Homebrew-Gameboy-Cartridge
==========================

**DOESN'T WORK**, at least my (Alan) version. Don't use this, you'll waste money.


Eagle library, schematic, and board files for a Gameboy Cartridge PCB that uses a Atmel AT49F040 to replace the ROM in a Gameboy cartridge.

Based on Gerry O'Brien's work on a D.I.Y. 512Kb NINTENDO Game Boy Flash Cartridge.
