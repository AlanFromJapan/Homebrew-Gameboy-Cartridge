Homebrew-Gameboy-Cartridge
==========================

Eagle library, schematic, and board files for a Gameboy Cartridge PCB that uses a Atmel AT49F040 to replace the ROM in a Gameboy cartridge.

Use the files on the [32kB-variant](https://github.com/dwaq/Homebrew-Gameboy-Cartridge/tree/32kB-variant) branch for a PCB that only supports 32kB ROM images since it does not use an MBC chip.

Based on Gerry O'Brien's work on a D.I.Y. 512Kb NINTENDO Game Boy Flash Cartridge.
